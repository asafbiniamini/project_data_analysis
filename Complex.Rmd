### Whether there is a realation between character appearnces to the IMDb rating
<p><p>

<p> To examine our hypothesis, we broke it into three main phases.<br>
1) Create a table that counts how many sentences the charterer spoke in an episode.<br>
2) Create a table that maps the rate and US views per episode (in millions). <br>
3) Combine the data and create a Complex regression.<p>

```{r, include= FALSE}
dt_king_of <- friends %>% select(speaker,season,episode) %>%
  group_by(speaker,season,episode) %>%
  filter(grepl('Chandler Bing|Joey Tribbiani|Ross Geller|Rachel Green|Monica Geller|Phoebe Buffay', speaker)) %>%
  group_by(speaker,season,episode) %>%
  summarise(per_episode = n())

prep_to_split <- dt_king_of %>%
  summarise(
    season,
    episode,
    Chandler_Bing = ifelse(speaker == "Chandler Bing", per_episode, 0),
    Joey_Tribbiani = ifelse(speaker == "Joey Tribbiani", per_episode, 0),
    Rachel_Green = ifelse(speaker == "Rachel Green", per_episode, 0),
    Monica_Geller = ifelse(speaker == "Monica Geller", per_episode, 0),
    Phoebe_Buffay = ifelse(speaker == "Phoebe Buffay", per_episode, 0),
    Ross_Geller = ifelse(speaker == "Ross Geller", per_episode, 0))

prep_to_split = subset(prep_to_split, select = -c(speaker))

Ross <- prep_to_split %>% select(season, episode, Ross_Geller) %>%
  filter(Ross_Geller != 0)
Joey <- prep_to_split %>% select(season, episode, Joey_Tribbiani) %>%
  filter(Joey_Tribbiani != 0)
Rachel <- prep_to_split %>% select(season, episode, Rachel_Green) %>%
  filter(Rachel_Green != 0)
Monica <- prep_to_split %>% select(season, episode, Monica_Geller) %>%
  filter(Monica_Geller != 0)
Phoebe <- prep_to_split %>% select(season, episode, Phoebe_Buffay) %>%
  filter(Phoebe_Buffay != 0)
Chandler <- prep_to_split %>% select(season, episode, Chandler_Bing) %>%
  filter(Chandler_Bing != 0)


grade <- friends_info %>% select(season, episode, imdb_rating, us_views_millions)

multiFull <- merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(merge(
  Ross,
  Monica, all = TRUE),
  Joey, all = TRUE),
  Rachel, all = TRUE),
  Chandler, all = TRUE),
  Phoebe, all = TRUE),
  grade, all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(season, episode)
```

```{r,include = FALSE}
filterd = multiFull %>% filter(multiFull$us_views_millions<50)
multiFull = subset(multiFull, select = -c(us_views_millions))
```



<br>
**The graph below shows the amount of sentences every character spoke **
<p>As can be seen, Ross and Rachel speaks the most, which might imply the result.<p>
```{r}
rank_speakers  <-  merge(dt_king_of,grade,by = c("season","episode"))
rank_speakers <- rank_speakers %>% 
  filter(!grepl('Sr.', speaker)) %>%
  group_by(season, episode) %>% 
  arrange(season, episode)

agg_score <- rank_speakers %>% group_by(speaker) %>%
  summarize(
    score = sum(per_episode)
  ) 

ggplot(data = agg_score, aes(speaker,score)) + geom_col(colour = "steelblue", fill="steelblue")
```

<p>For creating the table for the model, we manipulated the data in three stages:<br>
1) Group the data by charterer's name and count the utterances in every episode.<br>
2) Merge IMDb rating to each of the episodes.<br>
3) Select the only relevant information for the model.<p>
<br>
<p>In the table below, we can see the completed table.<br>
The table includes a different column for each character who holds the number of sentences in the episode.<br>
```{r}
head(multiFull)
```

<p>With the completed table, we ran the model.
The result below is the summary of the regression model.<p> 
```{r}
complex_reggrsion = lm(formula = imdb_rating ~ Ross_Geller +
                        Monica_Geller + Joey_Tribbiani +Rachel_Green + Phoebe_Buffay +
                        Chandler_Bing ,data = multiFull) 

summary(complex_reggrsion)

```

<p>Results: Ross and Monica are the only charterers that we found an effect between their's amount of utterances and the IMDB rating <br> (*their mom should be really proud*). <br>
In addition, we can see that Ross's result has the lowest Pr and the sharpest B1.<p>

<!-- calculate the linear function based on the regression model -->
```{r,include=FALSE}
equation1=function(x){coef(complex_reggrsion)[2]*x+coef(complex_reggrsion)[1]}
equation2=function(x){coef(complex_reggrsion)[3]*x+coef(complex_reggrsion)[1]}

**Demonstrate the relation between actor and rating**<br>
<p>The grapes below show the b1 of the regression for each variable.<br>
As can be seen in the regression summary, two variables impact the IMDb rating.<p>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = F}
liner_reg_Ross_Geller
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = F}
liner_reg_Monica_Geller
```
:::
::::

<br>

**Demonstrate no relation between actor appearances to rating**
<p>The grapes below show that b1=0 in the regression for each variable.<br>
The regression summary shows that four variables do not impact the IMDb rating.<p>


```{r,echo = F}
grid.arrange(liner_reg_Chandler_Bing, liner_reg_Rachel_Green,liner_reg_Phoebe_Buffay,liner_reg_Joey_Tribbiani,nrow = 2)
```


<p>At this stage, we saw a connection between Phoebe's utterances amount per episode and the IMDb rating.<br>
so to ensure our variables don't interfere and that the correlation and the strength of correlation between the predictor variables don't harm the regression model, we use the VIF function.<p>
<br>
<p>**The Graph below represent the VIF of the complex regression model**<br>
<br>

```{r}
vif_values <- vif(complex_reggrsion)
vif_values_value <- c(1.033673,1.095303,1.153097,1.029526,1.120718,1.017614,1.176870)
vif_values_names <- c("us_views_millions","Ross_Geller","Monica_Geller","Joey_Tribbiani","Rachel_Green","Phoebe_Buffay","Chandler_Bing" )
par(mar=c(5,10,4,1)+.1)
barplot(height=vif_values_value, names=vif_values_names, las =1 , width = 25, legend = TRUE,
        names.arg=c("us_views_millions","Ross_Geller","Monica_Geller","Joey_Tribbiani","Rachel_Green","Phoebe_Buffay","Chandler_Bing"), main = "VIF Values", horiz = TRUE, col = "steelblue", xlim = c(0,10)) 
  abline(v = 5, lwd = 3, lty = 10)
```
<p> As can be seen, no variable got more than 5, which means that they are fine.<p>

<h3>our conclusion: Ross is the character who brings the most rating to every episode!</h3>
