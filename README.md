*Overview*
The project will discuss the relations between the collected data from the series “Friends” to the IMDb rating and the character’s emotions along the series.
Our two Research Questions our models come to solve are:
1. Who is the character brings the most rating to the series?
2. Have any differences in the proportions of emotional expression between females to males?
