**Data Preparation and examination**
<p>Before starting working on the project, we wanted to ensure that the rating was not steady during the series.<br>
To examine this hypothesis, we created three visualizations which helped us understand how's the data looked like<br>
1) Density<br>
2) Change over time<br>
3) Relation between US view to IMDb rating <p>

**density of the rating**
<Before starting working on the data, we wanted to know if IMDB rating is distributed evenly, Normally or other known distribution.<br>

<p>As can be seen, the distribution looks like a Normal, with a big variance <p>

```{r, include=TRUE}
rating_dentisy <- ggplot(friends_info, aes(x=imdb_rating)) + 
  geom_density(col ="steelblue", fill = "steelblue" )

rating_dentisy

```
<p>For checking the hypothesis we conducted a Shapiro test to examine it.<p>
```{r}
shapiro.test(friends_info$imdb_rating)
```
<p>By the above result (p-value is less than 0.05), we deny our null hypothesis, in which the distribution is Normal.<br>

<p>
<br>
**Change Over Time**
<p>As well as the type of distribution, we wanted to be unsure that the IMDb rating is not steady over time.<br>
As can be seen in the graph below, the IMDb rating is not steady and without a permanent pattern.<p>
```{r}
mean_rating_per_season <- ggplot(data = friends_info, aes(x = interaction(season, episode), 
                      y = imdb_rating, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(col ="steelblue") 
mean_rating_per_season
```


<br>
**Relation between the US view to IMDb rating**
<p>In addition to the above tests, we assume that the US_million_views will Impact our hypothesis as it may have a high correlation with rating.
<br> So we visualize the relation between them by two means.<br>
1) Average rating of the episode based on how many views it got.<br>
2) Pearson Test to ensure correlation.<p>

<p>The graph below shows the average IMDb rating categorize on US views in millions<br>
As can be seen, there is a visual correlation between the number of views and the average IMDb rating.
<p>

```{r}
dt <- friends_info %>% select(us_views_millions, imdb_rating)
interval_breaks <- c(0,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,55)

dt_grouped <- dt %>%
  mutate(views = cut(us_views_millions, breaks = interval_breaks)) %>%
  group_by(views) %>%
  summarize(
    rate = mean(imdb_rating)
  )
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
Point_plot <- ggplot(data= dt_grouped, aes(x = views, y = rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, shape = 23, colour ="steelblue", fill = "steelblue") + ylim(7.5,10)

col_plot <- ggplot(data= dt_grouped, aes(x = views, y = rate)) +
  geom_col(size = 2, fill = "steelblue") + ylim(0,10)
```

<br>
<p> To ensure that there is a real correlation, we conducted a **Pearson Test**.<br>
The graph result below shows the result of the correlation test between US millions of views to IMDb rating<p>
<p>As can be seen, the P-value is less than 5%, which means there is a correlation between the number of views and the average IMDb rating.<br>
Moreover, the test gives us the correlation coefficient, which stands at 0.377.<p>
